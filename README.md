Research goal:
Compare the change of style of Avicii to the change of Kygo's style over the years.

Week 10 plots:
In the png file are two chordograms. The first one is one of Kygo's 'Raging', while the second one is of Avicii's 'The Nights'. In the plots can be seen that 'Raging' has some kind of pattern where the chords are repeated after some time, while 'The Nights' has three moments where some of the same chords are used. Both songs make use of a so called 'drop'.  This has probably some relationship with these chordograms and how they are represent the song.
