# myrepo
Repository for testing my Git/GitHub setup

Research goal:
Compare the change of style of Avicii to the change of Kygo's style over the years.

Comments plot:
This plot is supposed to be a test to see if all the software works. It is still an ugly plot and does not say much, but it works. You can see the mean Acousticnes, Danceability and Energy of the playlists "This is Avicii", "This is Kygo" and "Disney Hits". I put the Disney Hits in it for perspective, but it does not add much, as all the values are a bit in the middle (not surprising, since it is the mean).
